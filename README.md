Analysis of Failure Trends in Aircraft Engines to Predict Aircraft Engine Remaining Useful Life through Data-Driven Techniques
1. Introduction
Accurate prediction of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in aircraft engines is of paramount importance in aviation maintenance, as it facilitates the early detection of potential failures, enabling timely maintenance or replacement of engine components. This, in turn, significantly enhances aviation safety and operational efficiency. In the context of this project, our primary focus lies on the preprocessing of sensor data and the development of a sophisticated machine- learning model for RUL prediction. The ultimate goal is to harness data-driven techniques to uncover the underlying factors that influence RUL, subsequently building predictive models to address this crucial aviation challenge. This report offers an in-depth exploration of our project's objectives and findings.
Predicting RUL is a mission-critical task in aviation maintenance, and this project leverages the extensive sensor data provided by the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dataset to develop and validate a model for RUL prediction. By harnessing this wealth of sensor data, our aim is to make a meaningful contribution to the enhancement of aviation safety and operational efficiency.
